# drone-simulator
The code simulates a basic user interface (UI) for a drone application. It provides users with the capability to monitor drone telemetry, such as its speed, heading, and altitude. Additionally, it enables users to input desired parameters (autopilot settings) and activate/deactivate certain toggles for the drone.
